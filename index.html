<h1>The Timeless Soul</h1>
<p>thoughtful and enlightened in all its incarnations,<br>
can stand only as a sentence,<br> 
an incomplete sentence at that.<br>
An intellectual endeavor you'll fight for<br>
So mysterious,<br> 
 but are you serious?<br>
The Timeless Soul is a question.<br> 
Not yet discovered,<br>
But related to exploration.<br>
Be True and Get Real.<br>
Tell me, are you serious?
